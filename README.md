# CMP105 2023-4 

Forbidden Rhythms. 
by William Kavanagh.

A simple rhythm-movement game with a Chrome-dino-inspired intercedent level.

Note: This is not polished, or bug-free. But it (mostly) works. There are thousands of ways in which it can be improved/extended/expanded/remade/rebuilt.

This is an optional project to be extended by CMP105 students for the individual submission starting in week 9.
